    <p class="text-center">That’s Savage specialise in high quality, custom print garments and logo design. With over 10 years experience
      in design and 5 years garment printing, we are confident that we can supply a tailor made print to your liking.
      There are no minimum order requirements meaning that we can print special one off garments while also catering for
      much larger orders.
    </p>

    <p>Using three different methods for printing; Sublimation Print, Vinyl Transfer and DTG (direct to garment),
      the perfect print can be made especially for you.
    </p>

    <p><b class="text-warning">Sublimation Print:</b> Heat pressed at 190 degrees, these transfers are suited for polyester
      jersey type material. Our sublimation process works best on light colours allowing your design to really
      stand out. Max print size, A4.
    </p>

    <p><b class="text-warning">Vinyl Transfer:</b>  Using our Silhouette Cameo cutting machine, we can cut vinyl as small as 3mm. The vinyl that we
      use can be layered to create images that have multiple colours (up to 5) and this process works on the vast
      majority of garment material. We carry vinyl in dozens of various colours which include; gold, silver, glitter
      gold and rose gold. Should you have any specific colour requirements that we don’t stock, we can source for you.
      Max print size 300mm wide x 500mm high.
    </p>

    <p><b class="text-warning">DTG:</b> The beauty of DTG printing is that you have unlimited colour options for prints on 80% + cotton blend
      clothing. Photographs, blended and gradient colours are easily printed onto cotton t-shirts using DTG printing.
      Max print size 340mm wide x 400mm high.
    </p>

    <p>A wealth of experience allows us to design a product, produce a model and manufacture a high quality garment with
      the most suitable print method.
